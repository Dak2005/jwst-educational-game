      "options": [
        "It's the closest point to stars and easiest to maintain",
        "L2 offers gravitational stability and constant shielding from Sun, Earth, and Moon, but poses challenges with thermal stability, limited repairability, and orbital corrections",

        "It provides the best view of all planets simultaneously"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The L2 Lagrange point provides gravitational stability allowing JWST to maintain position with minimal fuel, while the sunshield can simultaneously block radiation from the Sun, Earth, and Moon. However, this location is 1.5 million km from Earth, making repairs impossible and requiring precise orbital corrections.",

        "All telescopes can observe the same phenomena equally well",
        "Optical telescopes are limited by atmospheric distortion, infrared need cooling systems to reduce thermal noise, and radio telescopes penetrate dust but require large arrays for resolution - each choice influences observable phenomena",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Each telescope type has fundamental physical limitations: optical telescopes suffer atmospheric scintillation and extinction, infrared telescopes must overcome thermal background noise requiring cryogenic cooling, and radio telescopes need enormous collecting areas for sufficient resolution.

      "explanation": "High redshift galaxies are observed as they existed billions of years ago due to light travel time.

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Kepler's laws predict orbital velocities should decrease with radius as v ∝ r^(-1/2) for visible matter distributions. Observed flat rotation curves require additional gravitational mass not accounted for by stars and gas - this 'missing mass' is attributed to dark matter halos extending well beyond visible galactic disks.",

      "explanation": "The CMB represents the universe's transition from plasma to neutral atoms at recombination (~380,000 years post-Big Bang).

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Stellar fusion via the pp-chain and CNO cycle creates elements up to iron-56, where nuclear binding energy peaks. Elements heavier than iron require energy input, created during supernovae through rapid neutron capture (r-process) and slow neutron capture (s-process) in AGB stars.

Lack of magnetosphere exposes surface to cosmic radiation and solar particle events. Global dust storms affect solar power generation. Perchlorate-contaminated regolith complicates agriculture.
